### Medical Camps

Medical camps are expected to be a regular monthly seva at the school. We need to have a general physician visit on a monthly basis and checkup the students and their progress. This can be conducted at the school premises on Sundays.

When working with a child, be sure to maintain a child-card for each child. This child-card should be regularly updated. Ensure there are vaccines. A sample child card is given as Exhibit 1 of Appendix.

Medical seva should be done as a volunteer seva, i.e., children should not be given any medication or treatment without explicit involvement of the parent. Check up or medication should be done in the presence of parents.

In the first camp, take the complete medical profiling of the student and fill in the child card and file it correctly, which should be maintained with the school authorities, to be used in emergencies. Update the card with the progress of the child in the monthly check-up. In the case of chronic diseases, advise the parents with the proper prescription to consult the specialists in the government hospital. If resources permit, we can volunteer to accompany the children and their parents to the general hospital. If resources permit, we can also undertake pathological tests of select needy cases.
