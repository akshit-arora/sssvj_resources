Loving Sairam,

This website is meant to collect all the activities you can perform in SSSVJ Schools in one open platform.

The main aim is to make this repository a one-stop solution for all the activity needs in SSSVJ. If you want to contribute, feel free to make a PR request or connect with any of the contributors of this project.

Initially, all the activities being added in the website is referenced from the [Activity Guidelines for Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Jyothi Program](files/SSSVJ_Activity_Guidelines_v1-1-1.pdf).
